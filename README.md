## Lazy Manc - Haskell Book Study Group
> (Haskell is a pure and lazy functional language)

### Do you want to learn Haskell from scratch in Manchester, UK? If so, join [the slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/lazymanc/shared_invite/enQtMjQ5NDYyNDEzMzc3LTUyZTJjOTZmYTNlZjRmZmIzMDQ3NTMxMTIwYWQ2YzNkNzUxMzc4NmI2MGZhYjcxNDRkY2UxMzQ2MTdhODZjMDM)

#### Who am I?
My name is Adam, I've been learning/applying Haskell fairly seriously in side projects over the last year but don't yet feel that I've broken away from my Object-Oriented day-job way of thinking about problems. I began to work through the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) and got quite far, though I was a bit lax with the exercises, but eventually trailed off due to lack of motivation/time.

I feel that it would help me, in the same way that going running with a group of people helps me, to study the book in a group, learning together and encouraging each other to continue.

#### A commitment

For reasons of focus and of valuing everyone's time I'd be looking for a commitment to:

1. Buy the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) (currently $59 for the content-complete PDF/ePub)
2. Read one or two chapters (depending on what we decide each week) in the week leading up to meeting up
3. Do the exercises for that/those chapter(s)
3. Attend a meeting in Manchester city centre (currently at Ziferblat) to talk over the chapter(s) and the exercises together each week (excepting the Christmas period)
    - or catch-up in your own time if you can't attend
    - but do not attend if you've not put in the time to work through the chapter yourself - everyone's time and needs should be respected
5. (Optionally!) go for a pint afterwards

We're currently on chapter 11 (at time of writing - see slack channel for updates) and expect that new joiners would be able to catch up to that level in order to join!

_I appreciate that I've set this out quite strictly, and I hope that's not off-putting - I'm just very time-poor and have enough organisational experience to know what a time-sink any regular activity can be!_

If you can get to Manchester, UK, on a weekly basis and are interested in joining, please join [the slack group I set up](https://join.slack.com/t/lazymanc/shared_invite/enQtMjQ5NDYyNDEzMzc3LTUyZTJjOTZmYTNlZjRmZmIzMDQ3NTMxMTIwYWQ2YzNkNzUxMzc4NmI2MGZhYjcxNDRkY2UxMzQ2MTdhODZjMDM).

#### Output

We post our solutions to a [repo](https://github.com/ahri/lazymanc.net/tree/master/Solutions), and maintain a [wiki](https://github.com/ahri/lazymanc.net/wiki).
