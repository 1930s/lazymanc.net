## Lazy Manc - Haskell Book Study Group
> (Haskell is a pure and lazy functional language)

### Do you want to learn Haskell from scratch in Manchester, UK? If so, join [the slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/lazymanc/shared_invite/enQtMjQ5NDYyNDEzMzc3LTUyZTJjOTZmYTNlZjRmZmIzMDQ3NTMxMTIwYWQ2YzNkNzUxMzc4NmI2MGZhYjcxNDRkY2UxMzQ2MTdhODZjMDM)

#### Who am I?
My name is Adam, I've been learning/applying Haskell fairly seriously in side projects over the last couple of years but didn't feel that I'd broken away from my Object-Oriented day-job way of thinking about problems. I began to work through the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) and got quite far, though I was a bit lax with the exercises, and eventually trailed off due to lack of motivation/time.

My second try was to form this group and progress through the book together. This turned out really well; we finished the book and went on to study other bits and pieces that interested us and are currently studying another book in the same sort of format.

There's been some interest from others who would like to learn Haskell to go through the book in the same way, and I think it could be helpful for those of us who have completed it to be on-hand to help that process. Not teaching, but aiding in self-study and provding a place to chat about and to explore problems.

#### A commitment

For reasons of focus and of valuing everyone's time I'd be looking for a commitment to:

1. Buy the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/) (currently $59 for the content-complete PDF/ePub)
2. Read one a chapter in the week leading up to meeting
3. Do the exercises for that/those chapter(s)
3. Attend a meeting in Manchester city centre (currently at Ziferblat) to talk over the chapter and the exercises together each week (excepting the holiday periods)
    - or catch-up in your own time if you can't attend
    - but do not attend if you've not put in the time to work through the chapter yourself - everyone's time and needs should be respected
5. (Optionally!) go for a pint afterwards

_I appreciate that I've set this out quite strictly, and I hope that's not off-putting - I'm just very time-poor and have enough organisational experience to know what a time-sink any regular activity can be!_

If you can get to Manchester, UK, on a weekly basis and are interested in joining, please join [the slack group I set up](https://join.slack.com/t/lazymanc/shared_invite/enQtMjQ5NDYyNDEzMzc3LTUyZTJjOTZmYTNlZjRmZmIzMDQ3NTMxMTIwYWQ2YzNkNzUxMzc4NmI2MGZhYjcxNDRkY2UxMzQ2MTdhODZjMDM).
